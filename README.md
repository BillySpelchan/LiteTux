# LiteTux
A simplified version of SuperTux (a SMB clone) with a Mixed Initiative Editor and used as part of Billy D. Spelchan's Master's thesis.

# Game

Due to the use of licensed sound effects, there are no sounds provided with the initial release of the source code. 
You can play the game with sound at LiteTux.ca

# Editor
Is in the process of being cleaned up and will be released shortly.

# Future plans
- Improve animation. 
- Add open sound effects.
